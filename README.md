# Anthropic Models: A Surprising Measured Comparison
Runs two simple test prompts against 5 Anthropic models. Visually compares speed, capability, costs.

The notebook is the base analysis for [Pushing Aside the Bench for the Mark](https://ailearnlog.com/pushing-aside-the-bench-for-the-mark/) â€” a simple article for product managers.

## Usage
Open Notebook here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michellepace/anthropic-model-compare/blob/main/Anthropic_Model_Compare_(simple).ipynb)

It will cost about US$ 0.98 to run the notebook. Otherwise you can load historical results instead (see [Results folder](https://github.com/michellepace/anthropic-model-compare/tree/main/results)).
