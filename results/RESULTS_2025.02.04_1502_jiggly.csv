Using chlorophyll in their leaves, these organisms absorb sunlight and use it to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is captured and used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose produced serves as food for the plant and provides energy for growth, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere. This remarkable process is crucial for life on Earth, as it produces oxygen and serves as the foundation of most food chains by creating energy-rich compounds from simple inorganic molecules.",,,8.00E-07,4.00E-06

Through a series of chemical reactions, they transform these raw materials into glucose (a sugar) and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process is crucial for life on Earth, as it provides food for the organism and produces oxygen for other living beings while simultaneously removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
